# object-tracer

`object-tracer` allows you to listen to different events on an object:
* `Method Calls` - what does the object do
* `Traces` - TODO - how the object is used by the application
* `State Mutations` - what happens inside the object

Heavily inspired by the ruby package [`ObjectTracer`](https://github.com/st0012/object_tracer)

**The goal is to let you know all the information you need for debugging with a single line of code.**

## Installation

pnpm install object-tracer --save-dev
```
